# word-info

This is a React.js app that I made. It essentially works like a dictionary, returning the meaning of the text that the user types in a formatted manner.

Main concepts I learnt from making this project (in no particular order) :
1. Using an API within react
2. Mapping an array and use the elements within multiple components
3. Context in react - using it to add the **Toggle Theme** button on my application
4. Styling, of course
5. Using states in React dynamically - for example, the loading text
